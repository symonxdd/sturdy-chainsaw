  <h1>AVD Launcher</h1>
</div>

- A lightning-fast, ultra-lightweight native app for launching Android Virtual Devices.  
- Cross-platform, portable, and minimal.
<br/><br/>

## 🔧 Prerequisites

To build or run in live dev mode, follow the [official Wails installation guide](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation).  
You'll need Go installed, along with Node and a package manager like `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.
<br/><br/>

## ⚙️ Live Development
To start the app in live development mode:
```bash
wails dev
```
This runs a Vite-powered dev server with hot reload for the frontend.
<br/><br/>

## 📦 Release Build
To generate a production-ready, standalone binary:
```bash
wails build
```
This compiles the app and outputs a native executable, ready to distribute.
<br/><br/>
